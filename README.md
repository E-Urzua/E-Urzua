- 👋 Hi, I’m @E-Urzua
- 👀 I’m interested in ...  academically, computational science high performance and Scientific computing, numerical methods to partial differential equations, 
                             mathematical modeling and a passing interetst in machine learning and AI. Outside of that I can be found playing games, watching
                             (world) football, hanging with freinds and working out.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... aghhh... alot. Currently a computational science grad student so a lot of computer science things. Summer 2021 will primarily be
                                 dedicated to mimetic methods for PDEs, parrallel computing, app development and a bit of machine learning and Stats if I have to 
                                 for the last thing.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... research in the earth sciences and in particular research that is related to the effects climate change will have on the 
                                       ecosystem, ice sheet modeling, and using AI/machine learning/nueral networks to solve PDES. 
- 📫 How to reach me ... many of ways. You can alwasy try me here, my emails (personal = urzuaerik@gmail.com, universities = eurzua3114@sdsu.edu, urzuae@uci.edu) 
                          and if you are feeling really bold, you can try me on the gram @e._.urzua
